# Intro-to-Applied-AI-real-estate
Build a model in RapidMiner that could help us predict the resale prices of houses before we decide which ones to buy based on data given by professors.

## Objective
Clean and transform data to develop a model to find profitable home buying opportunities. Clean the data, transform variables to be usable in model, enineer features to improve model accuracy, train and test the model to ensure accuracy in real world context.

## Outcome
Iteratively developed mutltiple linear regression models by addinng features from additional dataset sto see how they improve model performance

### Data Sources:
Given four separate csv files containing different variables pertaining to each house record.
